Hi

Thanks for giving me the chance to perform this task.

I believe I've correctly split up the main concerns into four key areas: Robot, Command Parser, Table and App (although i hate that name).

I realised towards the end that the App was getting a little crowded, and I potentially could've looked at moving some of that logic elsewhere eg. `def robot_movement`.

Also, the checks that are made in command parser are a little messy as well... apologies for that.

You can run this interactively by running `ruby run_robot.rb`

Exit this via hitting ctrl+c.

Or, you can pipe in a file for it to run, like the examples.txt file that's provided;
`ruby run_robot.rb < examples.txt`

I completely neglected to add a few integration tests, and it isn't really like me to do that, but i didn't want to hand this in any later than it is.

Apart from that, everything should be working fine... hopefully.

Thanks again for the opportunity. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Thanks
Andrew
